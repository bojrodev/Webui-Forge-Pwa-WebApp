**Resolver** is the ultimate **native Android interface** for [Stable Diffusion WebUI Forge Neo](https://github.com/Haoming02/sd-webui-forge-classic/tree/neo).
**Resolver** is also very much **compatible** with [Stable Diffusion WebUI Forge](https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge).

Unlike standard browser wrappers, Resolver utilizes **Native Android Foreground Services** and Wake Locks. This ensures your image generation queue continues processing background tasks (batch generations, huge Flux GGUF workflows) even when your phone screen is off or the app is minimized.

> **✨ Major Update (v1.1):** Now supporting **Flux GGUF**, **SDXL**, and **Qwen (Z-Image Turbo)** pipelines with a dedicated LoRA Management System and Local LLM integration.

## 🔌 The "Power Button" Feature

Resolver includes a remote wake/shutdown feature, allowing you to turn on your PC or wake your server directly from the app header.

**⚠️ Requirement:** This feature requires a lightweight helper application running on your PC.

**How to set it up:**

1.  **Download the Helper:** Go to the [Releases Page](#) and download `Resolver-Power-Server.exe`.
2.  **Run on PC:** Execute the file on the PC where WebUI Forge is installed. It will act as a listener for the mobile signal.
3.  **Configure App:**
    * Open Resolver on your Android device.
    * Tap the **Settings Gear** icon next to the Power Button (⚡) in the header.
    * Enter the Local IP address shown in the helper app console (e.g., `http://192.168.1.5:5000`).
    * Click **Save**.
4.  **Usage:** Simply tap the Power Button in the app header to send a Wake/Start signal to your PC.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Install "Forge Neo" (PC)
This app is strictly optimized for **Forge Neo** (Haoming02's branch), which supports Qwen, Z-Image, and Wan 2.2 models. Standard Forge may lack the necessary API endpoints for these features.

1.  Clone the **Neo** branch of WebUI Forge:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Haoming02/sd-webui-forge-classic](https://github.com/Haoming02/sd-webui-forge-classic) sd-webui-forge-neo --branch neo
    ```
2.  Edit your `webui-user.bat` file in the new folder.
3.  Add the following to `COMMANDLINE_ARGS`:
    ```bat
    --listen --api --cors-allow-origins *
    ```
4.  Run `webui-user.bat`.

### 2. Install Resolver (Android)
* Download the latest `.apk` from the **[Releases Page](#)**.
* Install on your Android device.

### 3. Link the App
1.  Ensure your phone and PC are on the same Wi-Fi network.
2.  Open Resolver.
3.  Enter your PC's Local IP address (e.g., `http://192.168.1.10:7860`).
4.  Tap **LINK**. The status dot will turn **Green**.
