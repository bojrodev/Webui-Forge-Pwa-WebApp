**Resolver** is a high-performance, native Android interface for [Stable Diffusion WebUI Forge Neo](https://github.com/Haoming02/sd-webui-forge-classic/tree/neo). 

Unlike standard browser wrappers, Resolver is built with a **Hybrid Architecture** (Capacitor 6.0 + Vanilla JS) and utilizes **Native Android Foreground Services** to ensure your generation queues never die in the background.

### 🧠 Magic Prompt (Local LLM)
* **Smart Expansion:** Integrates with local LLM servers (LM Studio, Ollama) to translate simple ideas into professional prompts.
* **Recommended Models:** For best results, use either of our official **Uncensored** fine-tunes:
  * **[v2 (Uncensored)](https://huggingface.co/bojrodev/BojroPromptMaster_uncensored_v2-8B)**: The latest engine with improved logic and reduced refusals.

## 🤖 Magic Prompt (LLM) Setup

To use the "Magic Prompt" feature, it is highly recommended to host a **Bojro PromptMaster** model on your PC.

1.  **Download a Model:** Get the GGUF version of your choice from Hugging Face:
    * 👉 **[PromptMaster v2 (Uncensored)](https://huggingface.co/bojrodev/BojroPromptMaster_uncensored_v2-8B)** (Recommended)
    * 👉 **[PromptMaster v1 (Classic)](https://huggingface.co/bojrodev/BojroPromptMaster-v1-8B)**
2.  **Run Server:** Load the model into **LM Studio** or **Ollama** and ensure it is serving on your local network (e.g., `http://192.168.1.10:1234`).
3.  **Connect App:**
    * In Resolver, tap the **Bot Icon** to open the Magic Prompt modal.
    * Enter your LLM Server URL and tap **Connect**.
    * The app will automatically use specialized system instructions for each image generation mode.
